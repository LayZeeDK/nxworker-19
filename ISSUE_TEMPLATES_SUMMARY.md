# Performance Optimization Issue Templates - Summary

## What Was Created

This PR adds comprehensive GitHub issue templates for all 14 performance optimization suggestions documented in `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_SUGGESTIONS.md`. These templates are specifically designed to work well with GitHub Copilot coding agent.

## Files Added

### Issue Templates (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`)

Created 14 individual issue template markdown files, one for each optimization:

1. `perf-01-project-dependency-graph-caching.md` - Cache project dependency relationships
2. `perf-02-import-specifier-pattern-precompilation.md` - Precompile import specifier patterns
3. `perf-03-lazy-project-graph-resolution.md` - Defer project graph creation until needed
4. `perf-04-batched-import-update-operations.md` - Batch import updates in single pass
5. `perf-05-path-resolution-memoization.md` - Memoize path operations
6. `perf-06-early-exit-on-empty-projects.md` - Skip empty projects early
7. `perf-07-string-interning-for-common-paths.md` - Intern frequently-used path strings
8. `perf-08-incremental-file-content-validation.md` - Cache import/export metadata
9. `perf-09-optimized-relative-path-calculation.md` - Cache relative path calculations
10. `perf-10-project-import-path-lookup-table.md` - Build project import path lookup table
11. `perf-11-targeted-file-filtering.md` - Filter unlikely import-containing files
12. `perf-12-smart-index-file-detection.md` - Cache index file exports
13. `perf-13-bulk-file-operations.md` - Batch file write/delete operations
14. `perf-14-conditional-formatting.md` - Format only modified files

### Supporting Files

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation about all templates
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` - GitHub issue template configuration
- `CREATE_ALL_OPTIMIZATION_ISSUES.md` - Guide for creating all issues at once
- `tools/create-all-optimization-issues.sh` - Bash script to create all issues (Unix/Linux/macOS)
- `tools/create-all-optimization-issues.ps1` - PowerShell script to create all issues (Windows)

## Key Features of Issue Templates

Each issue template includes:

### 1. Clear Structure
- **Optimization Goal** - What we're trying to achieve
- **Problem Statement** - Why this optimization is needed
- **Expected Impact** - Performance improvement estimate and complexity
- **Proposed Solution** - Code examples showing the implementation

### 2. Mandatory Testing Requirements
⚠️ **Critical:** Every template emphasizes that running benchmark and stress tests is **REQUIRED** and must not be skipped.

```bash
# Before changes
npx nx e2e workspace-e2e --testPathPattern=performance-benchmark
npx nx e2e workspace-e2e --testPathPattern=performance-stress-test

# After changes
npx nx e2e workspace-e2e --testPathPattern=performance-benchmark
npx nx e2e workspace-e2e --testPathPattern=performance-stress-test
npx nx run-many --targets=test
```

### 3. Acceptance Criteria
Clear checklist of requirements including:
- Implementation complete
- Performance benchmarks run before/after
- Stress tests run before/after
- All existing tests pass
- Code follows conventions
- Performance improvements documented

### 4. Priority Labeling
Templates are organized by priority:
- **High Priority (Quick Wins)** - 4 optimizations with best impact/complexity ratio
- **Medium Priority (Good ROI)** - 4 optimizations with good return on investment
- **Lower Priority (Incremental Gains)** - 3 optimizations with smaller improvements
- **Future Consideration** - 3 optimizations with high complexity

## How to Use

### Option 1: Create Issues via GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to https://github.com/nx-worker/nxworker-workspace/issues/new/choose
2. Select the appropriate performance optimization template
3. Review and submit

### Option 2: Create All Issues at Once

Using GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Unix/Linux/macOS
./tools/create-all-optimization-issues.sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
.\tools\create-all-optimization-issues.ps1
```

This will create all 14 issues with appropriate labels and priorities.

## Benefits

1. **GitHub Copilot Agent Ready** - Templates are structured as clear task descriptions
2. **Testing Emphasis** - Mandatory testing requirements prevent skipping validation
3. **Consistent Structure** - All templates follow the same format for easy review
4. **Priority Guidance** - Helps developers choose which optimizations to tackle first
5. **Complete Context** - Each template includes problem, solution, and acceptance criteria

## Expected Performance Impact

If all optimizations are implemented:

- **High Priority**: 15-20% improvement for same-project moves, 3-10% for batch operations
- **Medium Priority**: 3-10% improvement across various scenarios
- **Lower Priority**: 1-12% improvement in specific cases
- **Future Consideration**: 5-30% improvement (requires significant effort)

## Next Steps

1. **Review** the issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
2. **Create issues** using one of the methods above
3. **Prioritize** based on your specific performance needs
4. **Assign** to GitHub Copilot agents or team members
5. **Track progress** using GitHub Projects or Milestones

## Testing Compliance

⚠️ **Important:** All optimizations MUST run performance benchmarks and stress tests both before and after implementation. This is not optional and is clearly stated in every template.

The testing requirement ensures:
- Baseline performance is documented
- Improvements are measurable and verified
- No regressions are introduced
- Performance characteristics are well understood

**Total**: 61 implementation files, 48 test files, 10 domain directories  
**Tests**: 585 total (88 integration + 497 unit tests)  
**Status**: ✅ Phases 1-9 Complete

## Implementation Phases

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Constants & Types | Low | 1-2h | ~6 new files | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Cache Functions | Low-Med | 2-3h | ~13 new files | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | Path Utilities | Low-Med | 3-4h | ~18 new files | ✅ Complete |
| 4 | Project Analysis | Medium | 4-5h | ~26 new files | ✅ Complete |
| 5 | Import Updates | Med-High | 5-6h | ~18 new files | ✅ Complete |
| 6 | Export Management | Medium | 3-4h | ~10 new files | ✅ Complete |
| 7 | Validation | Low-Med | 2-3h | ~6 new files | ✅ Complete |
| 8 | Core Operations | Med-High | 4-5h | ~16 new files | ✅ Complete |
| 9 | Split Tests | Low | 3-4h | ~50+ test files | ✅ Complete |
| 10 | Benchmarks | Low | 2-3h | ~4 benchmark files | 🔄 In Progress |
| 11 | Documentation | Low | 2-3h | README updates | ⏳ Planned |

**Total Duration**: 35-42 hours (~1 week of focused work)  
**Completed**: Phases 1-9 (✅)  
**Next Up**: Phase 10 Performance Benchmarks (🔄 In Progress)

## Key Principles

1. **One Function Per File** - Each file contains a single focused function
2. **One Test Suite Per File** - Each function has its own test file
3. **Organized by Domain** - Functions grouped by purpose (cache, path, imports, etc.)
4. **Performance Benchmarks** - Critical functions have benchmark tests
5. **Zero Breaking Changes** - Public API remains unchanged
6. **All Tests Pass** - 140+ existing tests continue to pass

## Example: Before vs. After

### Before

```
generator.ts (1,967 lines)
├── 53 functions mixed together
├── Unclear dependencies
└── Hard to test in isolation

generator.spec.ts (2,650 lines)
├── 140 tests mixed together
└── Hard to find specific tests
```

### After

```
generator.ts (~200 lines)
└── Orchestration only

cache/
├── clear-all-caches.ts (20 lines)
├── clear-all-caches.spec.ts (50 lines)
├── get-project-source-files.ts (30 lines)
├── get-project-source-files.spec.ts (80 lines)
└── ... (3 more functions)

path-utils/
├── build-target-path.ts (40 lines)
├── build-target-path.spec.ts (100 lines)
└── ... (8 more functions)

... (6 more directories)
```

## Quick Start

To begin the refactoring:

1. **Read the full plan**: [REFACTORING_PLAN.md](./REFACTORING_PLAN.md)
2. **Review the ADR**: [docs/adr/001-refactor-for-maintainability.md](./docs/adr/001-refactor-for-maintainability.md)
3. **Start with Phase 1**: [REFACTORING_PHASE_1_GUIDE.md](./REFACTORING_PHASE_1_GUIDE.md)
4. **Run tests after each change**: `npx nx test workspace`
5. **Commit frequently**: Small, focused commits
6. **Update documentation**: Keep docs in sync with code

## Testing Strategy

### After Each Phase

```bash
# Run all tests
npx nx test workspace

# Run linting
npx nx lint workspace

# Build project
npx nx build workspace

# Run e2e tests
npx nx e2e workspace-e2e
```

### Continuous Verification

- All 140+ existing tests must pass
- New unit tests must pass
- No linting errors
- Build must succeed
- E2E tests must pass

## Risk Mitigation

### Low Risk Phases (1-3, 9-11)

- Simple extractions
- Easy to test
- Easy to revert if needed

### Medium Risk Phases (4-7)

- More complex logic
- Multiple dependencies
- Requires careful testing
- Integration tests critical

### High Risk Phase (8)

- Core orchestration changes
- End-to-end impact
- Comprehensive testing required
- May need multiple iterations

### Rollback Plan

- Each phase is a separate commit
- Can revert individual commits
- All tests must pass before merging
- No deployment until all phases complete

## Timeline

**Conservative Estimate**: 1-2 weeks of focused work  
**Optimistic Estimate**: 5-8 days of focused work  
**Realistic Estimate**: 1.5 weeks with reviews and testing

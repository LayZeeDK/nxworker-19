# Checks API Migration Summary

## Changes Made

This PR migrates the CI workflow from GitHub's Statuses API to the Checks API, providing richer metadata and better integration for branch protection.

## Key Files Added

### 1. New Action: `.github/actions/post-check-run/`

A new composite action that uses the GitHub Checks API:

- **action.yml**: Action definition with inputs (state, name, job-status, etc.)
- **src/main.js**: Implementation using `@actions/github` Checks API
- **src/main.spec.js**: Comprehensive unit tests (16 test cases)
- **README.md**: Documentation and usage examples
- **project.json**: Nx project configuration for build/test

### 2. Documentation

- **docs/CHECKS_API_MIGRATION.md**: Complete migration guide including:
  - Background and motivation
  - Usage examples (basic and matrix jobs)
  - Permissions setup
  - Stable check names for branch protection
  - Troubleshooting guide

## Key Changes to CI Workflow

### Permissions Updated

All jobs now have `checks: write` permission (keeping `statuses: write` for backward compatibility):

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    permissions:
      checks: write # New: for Checks API
      statuses: write # Kept for backward compat
```

### Action Calls Updated

Changed from `post-status-check` to `post-check-run`:

**Before:**

```yaml
- uses: ./.github/actions/post-status-check
  with:
    state: pending
    context: build # Old parameter
    workflow-file: ci.yml
    sha: ${{ steps.commit-sha.outputs.sha }}
```

**After:**

```yaml
- uses: ./.github/actions/post-check-run
  with:
    state: pending
    name: ci/build # New parameter: stable check name
    workflow-file: ci.yml
    sha: ${{ steps.commit-sha.outputs.sha }}
```

### Stable Check Names

The following stable check names are now used:

- `ci/build` - Build job
- `ci/lint` - Linting job
- `ci/test` - Test job summary (aggregates all matrix results)
- `ci/e2e` - E2E job summary (aggregates all matrix results)

These names can be used in branch protection rules. The summary checks aggregate results from all matrix job variants.

## Testing

All tests pass:

```bash
‚úÖ 16/16 tests passing for post-check-run action
‚úÖ 9/9 tests passing for post-status-check action (backward compat)
‚úÖ Workflow YAML syntax validated
‚úÖ Formatting checks pass
```

## Implementation Details

### How the New Action Works

1. **Pending State**: Creates a check run with status `in_progress`
   - Stores check-run ID for later updates
   - Sets rich summary with workflow metadata

2. **Outcome State**: Updates check run to `completed`
   - Uses stored check-run ID from pending state
   - Sets conclusion: `success`, `failure`, `cancelled`, or `skipped`
   - Fails the action if conclusion is `failure`

### Matrix Job Support

Matrix jobs use a summary job pattern to aggregate results:

1. **Matrix job**: Runs tests across multiple OS/Node.js combinations without creating individual check-runs
2. **Summary job**: Depends on the matrix job and creates a single aggregated check-run

Example:

```yaml
test:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      include:
        - os: ubuntu-latest
          node-version: 18
        - os: ubuntu-latest
          node-version: 20
  runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
  steps:
    - run: npm test

test-summary:
  needs: test
  if: always()
  steps:
    - uses: ./.github/actions/post-check-run
      with:
        name: ci/test  # Single stable check name
        ...
```

This creates a single `ci/test` check-run suitable for branch protection, with the overall result determined by whether all matrix jobs succeeded.

### Rich Metadata

Check run summaries include:

- Workflow file name
- Event type (pull_request, push, workflow_dispatch)
- Actor (who triggered the workflow)
- Git ref (branch/tag)
- Status indicators (‚úÖ ‚ùå üö´ ‚è≠Ô∏è)

## Backward Compatibility

- The old `post-status-check` action remains available
- Both `checks: write` and `statuses: write` permissions are set
- No breaking changes to existing workflows

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Merge this PR
2. üîÑ Run workflow to verify check-runs appear correctly
3. üìã Update branch protection rules to require new check names
4. üßπ Optional: Remove `post-status-check` after stabilization

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Richer UI**: Check runs display better in GitHub's UI with summaries and metadata ‚úÖ **Branch Protection**: Stable check names work better with branch protection rules ‚úÖ **Matrix Support**: Each matrix entry gets its own check run, easier to debug ‚úÖ **Future-Ready**: Checks API supports annotations and other advanced features ‚úÖ **Tested**: 16 comprehensive unit tests ensure reliability

## API Comparison

| Feature | Statuses API | Checks API |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Endpoint | `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/statuses/{sha}` | `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/check-runs` |
| Permission | `statuses: write` | `checks: write` |
| States | `pending`, `success`, `failure`, `error` | `queued`, `in_progress`, `completed` |
| Rich Output | No | Yes (markdown, annotations) |
| Update Support | No (creates new status) | Yes (update existing check) |

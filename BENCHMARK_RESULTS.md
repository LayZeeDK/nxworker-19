## Combined Effect Analysis

For a complex operation involving both optimizations (10 glob patterns + 30 repeated visits):

| Optimization        | Individual Speedup |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Glob Batching       | 8.86×              |
| File Tree Caching   | 29.82×             |
| **Combined Effect** | **~264× faster**   |

_Note: Combined effect is multiplicative when both optimizations apply to the same operation._

## Cache Effectiveness

### Cache Hit Rates (Simulated)

| Visits | Total Operations | Cache Misses | Cache Hits | Hit Rate |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------- |
| 5      | 5                | 1            | 4          | 80%      |
| 15     | 15               | 1            | 14         | 93%      |
| 30     | 30               | 1            | 29         | 97%      |

**Observation:** Hit rate improves with more repeated visits, approaching 100% for large numbers.

## Memory Usage Analysis

| Directory Size     | Memory per Cache Entry | Typical Entries | Total Memory |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Small (10 files)   | ~0.5 KB                | 3-5             | ~2 KB        |
| Medium (100 files) | ~2 KB                  | 3-5             | ~10 KB       |
| Large (1000 files) | ~20 KB                 | 3-5             | ~100 KB      |

**Impact:** Negligible (< 0.1% of typical Node.js heap)
